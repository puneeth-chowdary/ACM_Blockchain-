The code is written as part of ACM club assignment.As a  part of the assignment I have to create a simple Blockchain in python without using standard hashing libraries.In the code I have created two classes 1) Block (which describes the block parameters and the transaction data/data) 2) Blockchain (which is used to initialize genesis block,validate proof, add block).When user created an single object of class “Blockchain” an dynamic array is created, which store objects of class “Block” as an element. Class “Blockchain” have functions that mine new proof, validate mined proof, add a new block to the chain I.e appending an object of class “block” to array after the proof is validated successfully, and display function to display details of the blocks in the chain.The program have a custom hash function which uses polynomial rolling method to calculate hash  from index of block, time of creation,block data, previous hash and proof value(nounce) which is used in setting block parameter.
